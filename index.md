Welcome to Liangpeng Zhang's homepage.

I am a PhD student in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, U.K. 

My research mainly focuses on reinforcement learning, but I am also very interested in other branches of machine learning as well as evolutionary computation and AI in games.
